                        Hello everyone and welcome to the very first post on the SecretDino blog! Today marks an exciting new chapter for me: officially diving headfirst into the world of game development. For a long time, I've been fascinated by the intricate mechanics, captivating stories, and immersive experiences that video games offer. Now, it's time to try my hand at creating them.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        My journey will start with learning the fundamentals. I plan to explore various game engines, starting with beginner-friendly Godot and then diving straight into Unreal Engine . The initial focus will be on understanding core concepts such as game loops, physics, rendering, and input handling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I'll be documenting my progress, challenges, and successes right here. Expect posts about my learning resources, small prototypes, design ideas, and maybe even some early artwork. It's going to be a steep learning curve, but I'm incredibly excited about the creative possibilities. Wish me luck, and stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling adventure!
